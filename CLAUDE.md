DO NOT use any sort of Mock, Skip, etc. to fool me or to try to get the app functioning while not implementing the real functionailty. You will be harshly punished if you did so.

DO NOT use ASCII art when you are planning.

For long running tasks, REMEMBER to build the project and check the basic functionality of the features you added after your implementation. 

It is FORBIDDEN to use try-except in imports, you either don't import it or REQUIRE it. It is NOT AN OPTION to try to import and fallback to other solution if that import fails.

DO NOT overly handle errors. Code should fail fast, provide more context for debugging. I want a working codebase that implements the features I need, NOT a codebase that is running but does nothing.
